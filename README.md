As I sayd it's my first Django project. Currently I'm a Java student but my friend showed me how backend on python looks like and I've figured out a little bit about django's backend work. There are 2 working links in this project:
http://127.0.0.1:8000/playground/hello/
http://127.0.0.1:8000/playground/hello2user/

First will show you simple message which was created with django
The second one is same, but messages created using HTML)
